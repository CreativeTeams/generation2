        <center>Welcome to the creative teams test.</center>
        <br/><br/>
		This series of tests set out to explore how creativity changes between teams. Each test has it's own set of instructions and aims, please read each set of instructions carefully.
        <br/><br/>
        The focus of this system is to explore how creative you are as a team, we aren't looking at individual creativity, so don't worry, you (and your team) will remain completely anonymous.
        <br/><br/>
        Go on, give everything a go - the aim is explore your collective creativity, dream up things that no one else would think of, but which  still make sense!
       <br/><br/>
       Please alert the invigilator if you have any questions during or after the test.
       <br/><br/>
       Good luck!
