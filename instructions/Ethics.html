<b>Project Purpose and Procedures</b> <br>

The purpose of this research project is to study how creativity in teams is affected by geographic distribution. You are being asked to participate in this study to help form part of a test team. Each team will work together working either in the same room, or from different locations to complete a series of creativity tests. It is important to note that participation in this study has no bearing on your studies. The data collected during the study will be available to the principal investigator and co-investigators only. The anonymised results of the study may be presented at academic conferences or in academic journals (see Confidentiality below). 

If you agree to participate in the study, data collection will include information produced by the test itself, including a questionnaire.  Further to this, some of the sessions will be filmed to facilitate analysis. You will be informed if your session is going to be recorded beforehand and can opt-out of this part of the test at your descretion without affecting the rest of your participation. Recordings will be kept as encrypted files on secure drives and made available only to people directly involved in the data analysis. 

The purpose of this study is to better understand how creativity differs between teams. <u>The purpose of this study is not to evaluate you. Participation in this study has no bearing upon your studies.</u>
