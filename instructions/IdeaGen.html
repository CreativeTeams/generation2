An outdoor equipment company wants to release a new portable chair, suitable for hikers, 
tourists or attending music festivals, which is easily mobile but that can withstand 
the British weather. <br><br>

This is a very broad design brief, and your team has been asked to help refine it. Please can you list as many questions or pieces or information that the outdoor equipment company should provide about the chair to help create an improved requirements specification.
