<center><h1>Idea Generation Test</h1></center>

Your team has been asked by a manufacturer of sports and fitness products to identify new concept products. <br>
The manufacturer is particularly interested in products likely to be appealing to students. <br>
These products might be solutions to unmet needs or improved solutions to existing needs. <br><br>

They would like you to suggest as many new products as possible, with a description of what the new product is and how it might work.
<br> <br>
Ideas will be judged independently based on their potential impact.
